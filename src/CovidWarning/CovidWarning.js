                <p>We believe every member of the Cognizant team plays a critical role in protecting the health and safety of our clients and global community. Where allowed by local law, Cognizant requires associates of all Cognizant entities, subsidiaries, and joint ventures, including non-integrated business, as well as contractors, to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 if or when their role requires them to report to a Cognizant office, attend a company in-person meeting or event, or travel on Cognizant business to a destination where vaccination is required. In accordance with local law, vaccination will also be required when mandated by a client or the local law, regardless of work location. New hires will be asked to attest to their vaccination status and upload proof of vaccination as applicable after joining. </p>
